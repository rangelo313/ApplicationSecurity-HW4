The vulnerability in the REST API that is occurring is similar to assignment 2 csrf attack where attackers are able to steal giftcards from other users. 

The cardinterface.kt file contains a vulnerable named usecard which is the same vulnerable function seen in assignment 2
In this case - we can see that the function decorator is missing and the POC contains an card number parameter which can be manipulated to use a different card (ex: 301-302)
This does not check for the authorization token associated as well.


To correct this, all that needs to be done is ensure that there is an authorization token in the header which can be done from the server side.  This ensures that the user id of the card will check against the authorization header for an authenticated user.

To do this you would simply need to check against the url 
"https://appsecclass.report/api/index")

a header can be added with:   
headers: {"Authorization": "Token 56b35423218c567bk99055325gvc5y7969gmbe3571"}
